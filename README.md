Comes from a background of leading teams to success, using those organizational and people skills to create structure and a clear path to an end goal for projects. Still knows how to take direction and criticism from others in order to learn. Most recently worked on a team of two in order to create a single page MERN application that allows users to search events by title, venues, or cities and add them to a calendar for tracking and planning purposes. 

# Pinned Project Summary

## Go Together

Go Together is an event tracking app where users may search cities, venues, or specific events and add them to an interactive calendar. Each event has a link to Seat Geek where they may purchase tickets for the event. It also features a social media aspect where one may search and follow other users so you never have to miss out on events friends are attending either!

## Invoice Tracker

This is a simple budget tracker app created to help users manage their monthly cash flow.

## NoSQLSocialNetworkAPI

This is a framework for a social media network using REST API methods and a NoSQL database. 

## Weather Dashboard

This application I'm quite proud of. It's very simple, as it utilizes a public API to give a 7-day weather forecast for a searched city. The reason it's pinned is because I ccreated this quite early in my coding career, and almost all of the HTML on the page is dynamically generated! I put a lot of work into getting everything just right, so check it out!
